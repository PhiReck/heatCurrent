With the help of these files, it is possible to calculate the leadHeatCurrent in a time-dependent setup with the help of tkwant.

First, kwant (https://kwant-project.org/) and tkwant (https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/jbweston/tkwant) have to be installed.

To be able to calculate the HeatCurrents in(to) a lead, these files have to be moved:

1) 
'operator.pxd' has to be moved to the kwant folder (where operator.cpython-xxx.so is located), which can be found e.g. by opening a python interpreter and the following two lines:
        import kwant
        print(kwant.__file__)
  'operators.pxd' is needed to allow 'operatorsHeatCurrent.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so' to use classes from  'operator.cpython-xxx.so'.

2) 'defs.pxd' has to be moved to the kwant/graph folder (where 'defs.py' should be located.)  ??'defs.h' needed??
        
3) 
'operatorsHeatCurrent.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so' has to be in folder which can be by accessed python. Using a bash shell, one can for instance add the line 
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/THEPATHOFTHEFOLDERWITHTHE-SO-FILE"
to your '~/.bashrc/' file (and open a new terminal).

4) 
The 'installation' is complete. You can run now 'minimal-example-onebody.py' or 'minimal-example-manybody.py' (BOTH STILL MISSSING!) with your python3 interpreter in any folder you want.






The files 'operatorsHeatCurrent.pyx' and 'operatorsHeatCurrent.c' are not needed, but provide you with the source code with which 'operatorsHeatCurrent.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so' was compiled ('operatorsHeatCurrent.c' was generated by cython from 'operatorsHeatCurrent.pyx').
